# Task Description
On the basis of retaining the input in the form of ListBox, I added a graphical operation function.

Because I have a good abstraction of this program, all I have to do is add two window click event handlers,
and then modify the `insert_option_` and `delete_option_` variables in the event handler function.

# Demonstrate
## Insert at beginning

## Insert at end

## Insert at middle

## Insert until full

## Delete
